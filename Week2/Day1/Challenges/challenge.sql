SELECT COUNT(*) FROM actors;

-- Try to add a new actor with some blank fields. What do you think the outcome will be ?
-- The output of this SQL Syntax will be an error :

-- INSERT INTO actors(first_name, last_name, age)
-- VALUES (, ,);

-- Because I specified when creating the table to not have a NULL.
